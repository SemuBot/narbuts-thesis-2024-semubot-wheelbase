# Holonomic Motion Drive System of a Social Humanoid Robot SemuBot
Author: Georgs Narbuts

## ENG
This repository contains the design files needed for the fabrication of a holonomic motion wheelbase for the Social Humanoid Robot SemuBot.
The design folder contains both STEP, STL and 3MF files. 3MF files ending with ```(PRUSA)``` is made for Prusa Slicer, but ```(BAMBU)``` for Bambu Studio.

For the motion controller used in the testing of the wheelbase, see [here](https://github.com/SemuBot/narbuts-thesis-2024-semubot-wheelbase/blob/main/Software/Motion%20Controller/motion_controller.py).
